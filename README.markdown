iOS Minimalist
===============

This is an extremely simplified iOS template project. It is set up to use
[Google Toolbox for Mac](http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/) for
unit testing, [TestFlight](http://www.testflightapp.com) for beta testing, and
uses the rationalized file names from the [ZDS Code Style
Guide](http://www.cimgf.com/zds-code-style-guide/). That's about it! It's an
empty vessel to pour your own code into.
